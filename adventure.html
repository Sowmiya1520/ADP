            As travelers seek new and different experiences, adventure tourism continues to grow in popularity.
            Adventure tourism, according to the Adventure Travel Trade Association, is a tourist activity that includes 
            physical activity, a cultural exchange, or activities in nature. You don't necessarily have to go base jumping 
            or go scuba diving with sharks to be an adventure tourist (although those activities definitely qualify).

           Adventure tourism is about connecting with a new culture or a new landscape and being physically active at the 
           same time. It is not about being risky or pushing your boundaries. In fact, it is especially important to know 
           and respect your limits while you are in an unfamiliar area. Our list of adventure tourism activities has plenty 
           of options if you aren't necessarily a thrill seeker. If you are an adrenaline junkie, don't worry we still have 
           a few ideas for your next trip.
